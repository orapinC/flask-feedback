flask-feedback

This application lets users sign up and log in to their own accounts.
Once logged in, users can add feedback, edit their feedback, delete their feedback,
and see a list of all feedback that they've given.
These routes are proected, so that for example user1 can't edit a piece of feedback that user2 creted.
